# @shaval/validation

This is the validation package of **shaval**. Usually you would expect some kind of API documentation here. However, **shaval** has a different approach to documentation: [recipes](../../../..#recipes). They will show you how shaval can make life simple for you. In addition, due to our use of TypeScript, all API documentation you would want is contained in the code itself.
