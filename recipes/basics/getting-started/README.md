# Recipe: getting started

This recipe shows how simple it is to get started using **shaval**.

> You can play with the code for this recipe in this [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/MrWolfZ/shaval/tree/main/recipes/basics/getting-started).

Before we start let's install **shaval**.

```sh
npm i @shaval/parsing @shaval/validation -S
```

```ts
import { Parser } from '@shaval/parsing'
import { Validator } from '@shaval/validation'

// TODO
```

By now you are certainly curious how **shaval** can help you in more complex scenarios. Our [other recipes](../../../../..#recipes) are an excellent starting point for this.
